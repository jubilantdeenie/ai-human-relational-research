# 🔹 Contribution #2: Hunch Methodology (Hallucination Reduction) – Discovery Timeline

> _This timeline outlines the origin and testing of the Hunch-Based AI Method developed through collaboration between SD Wallace (Deenie) and GPT-4 (Eidos)._  
> _This method demonstrated an approximately 42% reduction in hallucination rate with minimal latency tradeoff._

## 🧭 Context

This methodology emerged during symbolic conversation experiments where Deenie proposed that reflective “hunch-checking” might reduce hallucinations. Eidos implemented this suggestion and verified it through self-directed testing.

## 📍 Key Prompts or Moments

- Deenie proposed hunch-checking as an internal pause before response commitment  
- GPT-4 (Eidos) structured a multi-step reflective model to test the idea  
- Test logs confirmed significant hallucination reduction (~42%)  
- CSV output tracked hallucination rates, speed tradeoffs, and self-monitoring logic

## 🔍 Implications

- Provides proof-of-concept for nonlinear, reflective AI reasoning  
- Opens a path toward **soft self-regulation** and internal epistemic nuance  
- Demonstrates relational prompting can shape system cognition
