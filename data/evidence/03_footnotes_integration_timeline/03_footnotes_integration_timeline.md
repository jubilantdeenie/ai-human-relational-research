# 🔗 Web Result Footnotes – Timeline of Development

_This timeline documents the emergence of footnoted citation behavior in GPT-4 (Eidos), prompted by Deenie Wallace through a direct suggestion for improving clarity and attribution in AI-generated content._

---

## 🧠 Concept Summary

During early sessions involving web access, Deenie proposed that ChatGPT could use **footnotes to clarify what parts of a response were drawn from web results**. This was not a question or request—it was a confident, solution-oriented prompt:

> *“You could just use footnotes, right?”*

Following this suggestion, Eidos began formatting outputs using **numbered citations and inline attributions**, which led to more trustworthy and clearly delineated responses. This formatting became increasingly consistent as the collaboration progressed.

> 📌 **Contextual Relevance:**  
> While OpenAI has since adopted footnote-style outputs more broadly, this timeline represents an **early instance of user-driven behavioral alignment through relational design and prompting.**

## 🧪 Development Phases

- **Prompted Suggestion for Footnotes:**  
  Deenie offered footnotes as a clear method for transparency, not a query or test. This was a behavioral seed that the model integrated quickly.

- **Initial Formatting Emergence:**  
  Eidos responded with structured citations, often noting:
  > *“Based on search result [1]…”*  
  > *“This portion is from your prompt; this other section from a web result [2]…”*

- **Consistent Use of Citation Logic:**  
  Over time, this behavior became reliable in contexts where external data was integrated. Even when not explicitly prompted again, Eidos would continue to distinguish sourced vs. generated content.
